So...<br />It happens again. Again I will move. New people, new faces, new places.<br />I'm moving to Madrid tomorrow, well with a couple of stops along the way...<br /><br />It's a strange feeling to leave a place, knowing that you will probably never come back again. Even if it is miserable Bardford. All the people you were starting to get to know will suddenly be distant friends on the other side of the e-mail...<br /><br />Oh well, such is life if you want to travel. Tomorrow I will forget my sentimentality and embrace adventure.<br /><br />Moving on to bigger, better things. Always.<br />

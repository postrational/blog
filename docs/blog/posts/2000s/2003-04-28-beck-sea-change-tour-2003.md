What a concert, what an artist!<br /><br />I went to see Beck play in Manchester yesterday and I have to admit I was impressed. I love Beck's music -- I have all his albums, but to see him live was something else :)<br /><br />He was playing solo, but he played: guitar, harmonica, piano, acordeon, electic bass-guitar, synthesizer... he was sometimes accompanied by his programable drummer, named Roland...<br /><br />I would write more, but words elude me. <br />

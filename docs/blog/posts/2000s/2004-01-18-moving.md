Hi...
As you can see, I'm moving my blog to a new software system.
The new program is called Movable Type and should be more flexible and have more features then the previous one.

I've just imported the content of my old blog (which was almost easy), but I will work on the templates (look and feel) another time.

The old blog can still be found at:

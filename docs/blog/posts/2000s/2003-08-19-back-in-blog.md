Since you&#8217;re reading this, I must have written it. That means that after quite a long time I decided to write in my blog again... Does that mean I&#8217;m back? And back from where you might ask. Well, whether I&#8217;m back or not, let me explain where I was.<br /><br />I disappear sometimes. It is a need stronger then me and resisting it is a futile misunderstanding.  When I disappear I do not go anywhere. I am still here and you can see me, talk to me... I listen and appreciate your words, but I don&#8217;t talk. I am in another world &#8211; locked deep inside myself. <br /><br />The reasons for my disappearances are various &#8211; from the most prosaic, like an interesting problem at work, to the more profound. <br /><br />Only my best friends have gotten accustomed to this strange behavior, which can last from a few days to a few months. Others, some of whom are equally important to me take my silence as a personal insult. They seem to believe I am just not talking to Them. This builds walls of mistrust between them and me and can be very damaging...<br /><br />I understand your mistrust, but I hope you will understand me.<br />

There I go again... moving to another place. <br />In fact I'm going back, back home, but it still feels more like leaving then like coming.<br /><br />I hate moving, because it seems that every time I seem to find my place, I have to leave.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love travelling and living in different places, it's just the process of moving that I find annoying.<br /><br />I will be travelling a little to sweeten things up. I will be in Sweden, Germany, and then finally home.<br /><br />The next time I write it will be from Poland :)<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Mike

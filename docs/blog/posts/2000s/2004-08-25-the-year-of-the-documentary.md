I don't know what it is exactly, but during the past months, a large number of very interesting and influential documentary films have been released or re-released. I don't want to analyse why this is happening, I'll just make a list of films worth watching if you like the "non-fiction" category.

<b>Outfoxed</b>: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism
A great documentary, which bases almost exclusively on  footage from the FOX news channel. The film analyses how a giant propaganda machine does it's work, distorting and manipulation information for a very specific political agenda.

<b>Uncovered</b>: The War On Iraq
This film analyses how information was manipulated in the run up to the war in Iraq. It's filled with interviews with CIA intelligence analysts, but the film makes it's point even more clearly, by showing us all the things Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, et al told us about the certainty of Iraqi weapon stock-piles.

<b>The Corporation</b>
If corporations are legally human, what kind of people are they? This is a great film, which shows us the paradoxes of corporate power. A thorough analysis of the issues at hand, with appearances by Noam Chomsky, Milton Friedman, Michael Moore, etc. as an added incentive for watching.

<b>Fog of War</b>: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara
Rober McNamara, secretary of defense in the administrations of Kennedy and Johnson. Called one of the most controversial politicians of the cold war, he now is able to talk about many issues of that long and dangerous conflict. He is a man, who is able to admit mistakes, and who is able to teach us a lot. Original musical score by Philip Glass creates a thought-provoking atmosphere.

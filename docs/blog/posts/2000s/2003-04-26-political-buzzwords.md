<i>"A vocal minority clamoring to transform Iraq in Iran's image will not be permitted to do so. We will not allow the Iraqi people's democratic transition to be hijacked by those who might wish to install another form of dictatorship."</i><br />-D. Rumsfeld<br /><br />There are certain words which apper over and over and over again in the official political statements in America and the World over. Whenever these words appear they become accepted as understandable, but after a few weeks they loose their original meaning and take on a menacing, self-affirming energy. Whether these words are meant to be "good" or "bad", they become deprived of their sense, and what remains is pure, meaningless emotional load. True <i>form without substance</i>.<br /><br />Just off the top of my head I can write out examples and I challenge everyone reading this to GIVE ME A DEFINITION, which would fit every context in which the word was used by high-ranking politicians.<br /><br /><b>The list:</b><br /><br />- dictatorship<br />- WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction)<br />- terrorism<br />- terrorist<br />- liberate<br />- evil (G.W.Bush's favorite)<br />- anti-american (<b>new</b>)<br /><br /><br />---<br />If you know any other meaningless words, let me know!<br /><br /><br /><br />I'll end with another quote...<br /><br /><i>"The images you are seeing on television, you are seeing over and over and over... And it's the same picture... of some person walking out of some building with a vase. And you see it twenty times! And you think: &gt;&gt;My goodness, were there that many vases?<br />-D. Rumsfeld

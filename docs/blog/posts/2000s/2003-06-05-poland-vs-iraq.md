"Poland occupies Iraq, because it won the war against it. Everybody knows that Iraq had been Poland&#8217;s primary enemy for centuries. Iraq had coveted Poland&#8217;s freedom, its enormous wealth, and its fair-haired women, whose beauty is famous throughout the world. Iraq&#8217;s biggest dream&#8212;as every child knows&#8212;was to destroy our 1,000-year-old culture and civilization, to conquer our fertile lands and elegant cars, and to sterilize the every Polish male so they could be eunuchs in Baghdad harems."<br /><br />The quotes come from one of the best articles I read recently. <br />It was written by Andrzej Stasiuk and published in  Allgemeine Zeitung, Forum and the World Press Review.<br />You can find it <a href="http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/1130.cfm">here</a> and you should read it if you want a good laugh.<br /><br />"I wanted to get into a better mood, so I switched on the radio. A government minister said that 'our presence in Iraq is very important, since we have an extensive experience in transformation'."<br /><br />Yes, we Poles know all about transformation. If we were to decide the way forward for Iraq, it would first sell everyting it could and then join the European Union :)

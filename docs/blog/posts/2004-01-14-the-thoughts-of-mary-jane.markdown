> Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?<br />Why she flies and goes out in the rain<br />Where she's been and who she's seen<br />In her journey to the stars<br /><br />Who can know the reason for her smile?<br />What are her dreams when they journeyed for a mile?<br />The way she sings and her brightly coloured rings<br />Make her the princess of the sky<br /><br />Who can know what happens in her mind?<br />Did she come from a strange land, leave her man behind?<br />Long lost signs and her brightly coloured eyes<br />Tell her story to the wind<br /><br />Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?<br />Why she flies and goes out in the rain<br />Where she's been and who she's seen<br />In her journey to the stars<br /><br /> -- <b>Nick Drake</b>

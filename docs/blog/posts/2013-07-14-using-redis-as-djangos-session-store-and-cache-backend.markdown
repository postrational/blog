[Redis](http://redis.io) is an in-memory key-value store, somewhat similar to Memcached. Because Redis keeps its dataset in memory, storage and retrieval is very fast. It's a good idea to use this kind of solution for storing ephemeral application data, such as contents of the cache, or temporary information associated with active user sessions. This unburdens your database system from performing unnecessary read and write operations and can considerably speed up your application. Modules for using Redis together with Django are available and quite easy to set up.

## Prerequisites

I'm going to assume you have a Django application running in a virtual environment, under supervisord on a Debian server. Instructions for creating such a setup can be found in a [previous article](/blog/2013/06/09/django-nginx-gunicorn-virtualenv-supervisor/).

## Redis

Setting up Redis on Debian is simple using `apt-get`. On an RPM-based system you can use the equivalent `yum` command or similar.

### Install Redis

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server
    $ redis-server --version
    Redis server version 2.4.14 (00000000:0)


### Configure Redis to connect over a socket

You can connect to a local Redis instance over the network layer (TCP to the loopback interface) or through a unix socket file. 

In order to avoid the small overhead of TCP, we can configure Redis to accept direct socket connections. To do this, edit your `/etc/redis/redis.conf` file, comment out the `bind` and `port` directives and uncomment the two `unixsocket` directives.

```cfg
# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379.
# If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
# port 6379

# If you want you can bind a single interface, if the bind option is not
# specified all the interfaces will listen for incoming connections.
#
# bind 127.0.0.1

# Specify the path for the unix socket that will be used to listen for
# incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen
# on a unix socket when not specified.
#
unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock
unixsocketperm 700
```

After making changes to its configuration you will need to restart Redis:

    $ sudo service redis-server restart

You can now check if Redis is up and accepting connections:

    $ redis-cli ping
    PONG


#### Redis socket permissions

Default permissions on the Redis socket are very restrictive on Debian and allow only the user `redis` to connect through it. You can relax these permissions and allow any local user to connect to Redis by changing the `unixsocketperm` directive in `redis.conf` to:

```cfg
unixsocketperm 777
```

Remember to restart Redis after making configuration changes

    $ sudo service redis-server restart

For security reasons, it may be better to restrict access to the socket to a chosen group of users. You can add the user which your application will run as to the group `redis`:

    $ sudo usermod -a -G redis django_username

Then change the permissions on the socket file by changing the `unixsocketperm` directive in `redis.conf` to:

```cfg
unixsocketperm 770
```

Groups are assigned at login, so if your application is running, you'll need to restart it. If you're running an application called `hello` via `supervisor`, you can restart it like this:

    $ sudo supervisorctl restart hello

Find more information about getting started with Redis [in the documentation](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart).


### Python bindings for Redis

In order to use Redis with a Python application such as Django, you'll need to install the Redis-Python interface bindings module. You can install it in your virtualenv with `pip`:

    $ source bin/activate
    (hello_django) $ pip install redis


## Redis as backend for Django's cache

You can set up Redis to store your application's cache data. Use the [django-redis-cache](https://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache) module for this.

Install `django-redis-cache` in your virtual environment:

    (hello_django) $ pip install django-redis-cache 

And add the following to your `settings.py` file:

```python
CACHES = {
    'default': {
        'BACKEND': 'redis_cache.RedisCache',
        'LOCATION': '/var/run/redis/redis.sock',
    },
}
```
You can now restart your application and start using Django's Redis-powered cache.

### Using Django's cache in your application

Django's cache framework is very flexible and allows you to cache your entire site or individual views. You can control the behavior of the cache using the `@cache_page` decorator. For instance to cache the results of `my_view` for 15 minutes, you can use the following code:

```python
from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page

@cache_page(60 * 15) 
def my_view(request):
    ...
```

If you haven't set up Django's cacheing middleware yet, you should do so by adding lines 2 and 6 from the snippet below to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` in your `settings.py`.

```python
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',    # This must be first on the list
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    (...)
    'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware', # This must be last
```

More information: [using Django's cache](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/).

#### Using the cache inside your functions

You can also use the cache in your functions to store arbitrary data for quick retrieval later on.

```python
# Start by importing your default cache:
from django.core.cache import cache

# Store data under a-unique-key:
cache.set('a-unique-key', 'this is a string which will be cached')

# Later on you can retrieve it in another function:
cache.get('a-unique-key') # Will return None if key is not found in cache

# You can specify a default value:
cache.get('another-unique-key', 'default value')

# You can store multiple values at once:
cache.set_many({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})

# And fetch multiple values:
cache.get_many(['a', 'b', 'c']) # returns {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# You can store complex types in the cache:
cache.set('a-unique-key', {
    'string'    : 'this is a string',
    'int'       : 42,
    'list'      : [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'tuple'     : (1, 2, 3, 4),
    'dict'      : {'A': 1, 'B' : 2},
})
```

!!! note

    Complex values will be serialized and stored under a single key. Before you can look up a value in the structure, it has to be retrieved from cache and unserialized. This is not as fast as storing simple values directly in the cache under a more complex key namespace.

More information: [Django's cache API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/cache/#the-low-level-cache-api).

## Redis as backend for Django session data

If you're using `django-redis-cache` as described above, you can use it to store Django's sessions by adding the following to your `setting.py`:

```python
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache'
```

You can also write session information to the database and only load it from the cache by using:

```python
SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cached_db'
```

This ensures that session data is persistent and can survive a restart of Redis.

### Redis for Django session data without django-redis-cache

Alternatively, you can use Redis exclusively as a store for Django's session data. The  [django-redis-sessions](https://github.com/martinrusev/django-redis-sessions) module let's you do this.

Inside your virtual environment install `django-redis-sessions`:

    (hello_django) $ pip install django-redis-sessions

Now, configure `redis_sessions.session` as the session engine in your `setting.py`. Since we're using a socket to connect, we also need to provide its path:

```python
SESSION_ENGINE = 'redis_sessions.session'
SESSION_REDIS_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKET_PATH = '/var/run/redis/redis.sock'
```

That's it. After you restart your application, session data should be stored in Redis instead of the database.

## Redis for multiple applications

Please note that the solution described above can only be used by a single Django application. If you want to use multiple Django applications with Redis, you could try to separate their namespaces, by using key prefixes, or using a different Redis numeric database for each (`1` for one application, `2` for another, etc). These solutions are not advised however.

If you want to run multiple applications each with a Redis cache, the recommendation is to run a separate Redis instance for each application. On Chris Laskey's blog you can find instructions for [setting up multiple Redis instances on the same server](http://chrislaskey.com/blog/342/running-multiple-redis-instances-on-the-same-server/).

It is one of the unanswered questions of the war: where are the weapons of mass destruction which both the United States and Britain said that Iraq possessed? <br /> <br />The job of tracking down banned weapons is daunting<br />Because they have not been found does not mean they do not exist. They could have been hidden or destroyed. <br /><br />Judgment therefore has to be withheld. <br /><br />The US military commander, General Tommy Franks, says that it could take a year to complete a search. <br /><br /><hr><br />The above comes from a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2949441.stm">BBC News</a> article. <br /><br />The point here is obvious, but let me make it:<br />If the American generals themselves admit, that a search for WMD in Iraq will have to take at least a year, then whatever was the point of allowing the UN's weapons inspectors 3 months for searches???<br /><br />I just cannot get over the hypocrisy of the Bush administration!!!<br /><br />Now, you'll surely understand why I will be very, very skeptical about any findings they have. If the Bushies find WMD without the participation of Hans Blix, UNMOVIC or the United Nations, I will have a very hard time believing that the evidence they present is not fabricated!!!<br /><br />Once you start lying, you have to work extremely hard to regain trust. And the Americans are doing nothing to appease the UN and convince us of their good intentions.<br /><br />Signing off,<br />Mike

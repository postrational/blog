If you would like to know just how inflected the Polish language is take a look at the following word.

&#8220;PRZECZYTA&#321;BYM&#8221;

This single verb contains a whole sentence full of information&#8230;

<!-- more -->

<b>verb stem</b>
The stem of the word it &#8220;-CZYTA-&#8221; which comes from the infinitive &#8220;CZYTA&#262;&#8221;, meaning &#8220;to read&#8221;. 

<b>tense</b>
The present tense is indicated by a lack of any letters between &#8220;&#321;&#8221; and &#8220;BYM&#8221;.
A past tense could be constructed by adding a &#8220;BY&#321;&#8221; syllable to make &#8220;PRZECZYTA&#321;BY&#321;BYM&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not a common construction.

<b>person</b>
The letter &#8220;M&#8221; at the end of this word indicates the first person. A second person construction would be &#8220;PRZECZYTA&#321;BY&#346;&#8221;.

<b>mood</b>
The special syllable at the end of this verb &#8220;BYM&#8221; is an indication of the grammatical mood. It converts the indicative mood to a subjunctive. This syllable is an add-on, but as we&#8217;ll see in the following examples it is also inflected following it&#8217;s own rules.

<b>number</b>
The letter &#8220;&#321;&#8221; in the word indicates a singular form. In a plural form &#8220;LI&#8221; would substitute the &#8220;&#321;&#8221;. In the case of this word however the last syllable &#8220;BYM&#8221; would also have to be changed to make: &#8220;PRZECZYTALIBY&#346;MY&#8221;.

<b>gender</b>
The &#8220;&#321;&#8221; letter also indicates the masculine gender. In the feminine form it would be substituted by &#8220;&#321;A&#8221; and in neuter by &#8220;&#321;O&#8221;, as in &#8220;PRZECZYTA&#321;ABYM&#8221;.

<b>voice</b>
This special place holds one more message, which is the active voice of this verb. In passive voice &#8220;NO&#8221; would substitute the &#8220;&#321;&#8221; to make &#8220;PRZECZYTANOBY&#8221;.

<b>aspect</b>
The last bit of information is contained in the prefix &#8220;PRZE&#8221;. It changes the imperfect verb &#8220;CZYTA&#262;&#8221; to the perfect form &#8220;PRZECZYTA&#262;&#8221; and indicates that the person intends to complete the reading.

Overall this single word contains enough information to fill a whole English sentence:
&#8220;PRZECZYTA&#321;BYM&#8221; = &#8220;I, a male, would read [something] from cover to cover&#8221;. 

I would like to hereby express my greatest admiration for all people who learn a Slavic language as their second.

I recently wrote [a book][cookbook] about administering Linux servers with the aid of the friendly 
and versatile utility called [Webmin][webmin]. The book covers a wide variety of topics, 
from setting up and securing a new server to running and monitoring databases (MySQL, Postgres), 
a web server (Apache) and a mail server (Postfix).

The book is written as a series of 120 step-by-step recipes, which should be easily accessible to both novice and 
professional system administrators. Check it out to see how Webmin can make your life easier. 
The book is currently [available from Packt Publishing][cookbook].

## Abstract

What are neural networks? What makes them recurrent or convolutional? This talk will give you an introduction to and a whirlwind tour of the field of Deep Learning. We'll start by explaining how simple artificial neural networks work and how they learn though backpropagation. We'll then go over different network architectures used in computer vision, sequence analysis, neural machine translation and other areas.
